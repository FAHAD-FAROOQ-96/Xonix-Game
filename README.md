# 🎮 Xonix Game (C++ & SFML)

This is a simple Xonix-style arcade game built using C++ and the SFML graphics library. The objective is to capture territory by enclosing empty areas while avoiding enemies.

## 🧠 Game Concept
You control a block that moves inside a rectangular field. When you leave the edge and move into the empty area, you leave a trail. If you return safely, the area is captured. If enemies hit your trail, you lose.

## 🛠️ Built With
- C++
- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- CMake (for cross-platform builds)
